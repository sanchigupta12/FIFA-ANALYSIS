# FIFA Insight Crew Analytics

## Introduction
Welcome to the FIFA Insight Crew's analytics project repository. Our team, consisting of passionate data analysts and football enthusiasts, delves into the realm of football analytics using a robust dataset from FIFA. We aim to explore and answer pivotal questions about player performance ratings, positional play, age-related pace, and market values through the lens of statistical analysis and predictive modeling.

**Team Members:**
- Sankalp Susil Kumar Biswal
- Sanchi Gupta
- Sharanya Badrinarayanan
- Ratnesh Mishra
- Rhea John Thoppil

**Instructor:**
Vladimir Shapiro, Northeastern University

## Project Overview
Our project's heartbeat is driven by the four essential questions that shape the core of our analysis:
1. **Performance Rating Prediction:** Utilizing multiple regression techniques to predict players' overall performance ratings.
2. **Position Classification:** Employing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify players' on-field positions.
3. **Pace vs. Age Analysis:** Testing hypotheses to explore the effect of age on players' pace.
4. **Market Value Prediction:** Applying linear regression models to predict players' market values based on various attributes.

## Methodology
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Kickstarting the analysis by examining the summary statistics of the FIFA dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Preparing our dataset through meticulous cleaning, handling of missing values, and normalization of features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Leveraging statistical techniques to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations within the data.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Building and refining models to predict and classify players based on their attributes.
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Conducting tests to investigate assumptions about age-related pace differences among players.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of our models using metrics such as MSE, RMSE, and accuracy.

## Results and Conclusion
The findings from our extensive analysis reveal insightful trends and offer valuable contributions to understanding player dynamics in football. Our models shed light on the factors influencing player performance, the impact of age on pace, and the predictors of market value.
